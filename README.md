What I've learned so far:

Git:
mkdir is setting up a folder
cd is used as a navigation command
cd bring you to the user folder
ls shows you the folders in the specific cd you are in
cd with the folder name allows you to navigate the tree to the name of the folder you typed in following cd
touch command is used to create files
nano command is used to edit the contents of the file
add
commit
log

github:
setting up a repo is interesting...
click the plus
name the repo
select either public or private
add a readme
copy the ssh code in order for you to be able to clone that repo to your desktop so that the work remains in sync


html
"easy command" to set up a quick template for doing an HTML document by using !
The first page of a website must be named index.html
from memory:
<!DOCTYPE html> assign the type of document
<html>
<meta charset ="8"> this is basically the computers language of 8 bit
<title> assign the title of the site
<head> head of the page
<h1>
<h2> (all the way up to 7, 8+ do not exist)
<body>
<p>
<a href>
<ls> create a list element
<ul> the individual items in the list
